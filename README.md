⚛️ Questify - Our gamified To-Do-List Application:
This repository contains our most recent project of the "Questify" web-app. 
It is a fully working To-Do-List app with a gamified appearance to help progressing through your day to day challenges aswell as help with disordered executive Dysfunction.

This is the second version of an idea that we had in our adventurous bootcamp expierence that was initially called "daily questing". After the bootcamp we decided to keep working on the idea but start from anew to keep practicing clean coding.

🏁 Project Goal:
The goal of this project was to design, build and deliver an application that:

Helps people to remind themselves of what they should be doing.
Turn problematic tasks or pressure feelings into a more positive mindset and generate progress.
Delivers a smooth and simple User experience.

Aside of that it was meant to strenghten the teams coding skills aswell as stay connected to each other after our experience in a bootcamp.

🎴 Frontend
The frontend was built using various frameworks such as SCSS and JavaScript.

🔧 Backend
