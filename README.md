# ⚛️ Questify - Our gamified To-Do-List Application:

This repository contains our most recent project of the **"Questify"** web-app. 
It is a fully working To-Do-List app with a gamified appearance to help progressing through your day-to-day challenges as well as helping with executive dysfunction.

This is the second version of an idea that we had in our adventurous Le Wagon bootcamp expierence that was initially called "daily questing". After the bootcamp we decided to keep working on the idea but start anew to keep practicing clean coding.


## 🏁 Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to design, build and deliver an application that:

- Helps people to remind themselves of what they should be doing.
- Turns problematic tasks or anxious feelings into a more positive mindset and generate progress.
- Delivers a smooth and simple user experience.

Aside from that, it was meant to strenghten the team's coding skills as well as stay connected to each other after our experience in a bootcamp.
